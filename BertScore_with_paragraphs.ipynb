(Sagittarius serpentarius) is a large, mostly terrestrial bird of prey. Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savanna of the sub-Saharan region. John Frederick Miller described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal birds of prey such as hawks, kites, vultures, and harriers, it is placed in its own family, Sagittariidae.\n","The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on crane-like legs that give the bird a height of as much as 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in). The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black flight feathers and thighs.\n","Breeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledgling. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet.\n","Although the secretarybird occurs over a large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It appears on the coats of arms of Sudan and South Africa.\"\"\"\n","para2=\"\"\"History (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation')[1] is the systematic study and documentation of the human past.[2][3]\n","The period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory.[4] \"History\" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.[5] History is incomplete and still has debatable mysteries.\n","History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.[6][7] Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians debate the nature of history as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the present.[6][8][9][10]\n","Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends.[11][12] History differs from myth in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. However, ancient cultural influences have helped create variant interpretations of the nature of history, which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is taught as a part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in universities.\n","Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the \"father of history\", as one of the first historians in the Western tradition,[13] though he has been criticized as the \"father of lies\".[14][15] Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies.[16] Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing.

Most studies evaluating renewable energy efficiency (REE) use a single-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, and thereby, ignore the interactions among economic, social, and environmental subsystems. In contrast, this study develops a matrix-type structure network DEA model that considers the influence of undesirable outputs and mutual interactions among these three subsystems to measure REE in China's 30 provinces. Examining the 2005 to 2019 timeframe, the study shows that: 1) the changes in China's REE reflect a significant “V” shape during this timeframe, with 2013 marking the boundary, owing to an improvement in the efficiency of the environmental subsystem; 2) REE improved in 15 provinces, decreased in 13, and barely changed in the other two; 3) REE tended to converge between 2005 and 2011 and diverge between 2011 and 2019; and 4) for further REE improvement, total fixed asset investments, fossil energy imports, and household waste collected and transported need to decrease by 26 %, at least; while GDP per capita, excellent air quality, and years of education need to increase by >4 %. The expansion of the advanced provinces contributes to REE improvement for international economies and industrial communities.

Content analysis was applied to study a sample of 223 COVID-19 vaccination-related videos from creators with at least 10,000 followers. The content analysis involved coding themes, video formats, the valence of attitude toward vaccination, and emotional expressions from the influencers. A majority of videos showcased personal vaccination experiences, followed by fictitious dramas and instructional information. More fictitious dramas expressed unclear attitudes, neither explicitly supporting nor opposing the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to personal vaccination stories and instructional videos. Some imaginative and dramatic scenes, such as zombie transformation or dramatic spasms after taking the vaccines, were widely imitated across influencers, perhaps humorously, and raised concerns about diminishing positive images of vaccine uptake. Videos with simultaneous expression of humor and frustration significantly predicted engagement when the video content opposed or was uncertain about taking the vaccine, implying the effectiveness of mixed emotional attributes within a message. This study provides insight into how social context and message choices by creators interact to influence audience engagement.\"\"\"\n","para9=\"\"\"my theory is that mihawk will be defeated or killed by a adult and marine trained s-hawk\n","\n","s-hawk has all mihawks abilities/ muscle memories and haki. he as a kid can use all of mihawks tecniques, moves and has all of mihawks combat ability, personality ( as shown by s-snake in the latest chapter) and the muscle memorie that come from kings dna and mr 1s devilfruit lineage factor.\n","mr1 devilfruit, the supa supa no mi wich allows hum to turn all his body into steel blades.\n","a lunarian body that naturally has stronger vitality and durability as well as winged powered flight and fire manipulation.\n","they pacifista cyborg inhancements, the lazer beam was already shown. we dont know if mark III bubble shield and other features of the pacifista are also included in the seraphim.\n","in chapter 1065 edison states \" the seraphim are still children, they are not ready for the lazer tests yet!!!\" wich means that the serafim are not in their \" final form\" and havent been tested to their full capabilities.\n","and if we go with the theory that the seraphim ( when fully grown) will be a \"perfect future\" version of the schibukai. that means a crocodile with 2 hands, slim gekko moriah...\n","we could be facing a mihawk with the power of someone who continued to fight, hunt marines and training. instead of the one that sips wine, scares anyone with the tile of strongest and cuts the weak. because beside shanks no one could be a chalange for him, so he stopped caring.\n","if he is trained by the marines we could expect rokushiki or other abilities added to his arsenal, maybe even a new powerfull supreme grade blade.\n","\n","basically, if let to grow to his full power he can far surpass mihawk, he will be the final chalange (or close to it) that zoro must face.\n","zoro will either protect or avange mihawk and thus making himself the greatest swordsman\"\"\"\n","para10=\"\"\"I have a story for y'all:\n","\n","I've been in this relationship for a few months and let's say things have not been very easy.
